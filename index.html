            <p class="fast-text">Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia.
                With few exceptions,
                animals
                consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually,
                and
                grow
                from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development.</p>

            <p id="second-test">All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix
                composed of
                collagen and elastic glycoproteins. During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a
                relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised.</p>

            <p>Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction. They produce haploid
                gametes by
                meiosis; the smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova.
                These fuse to form zygotes,</p>

            <h4 class="texts">Animals are found as long ago as the Ediacaran biota</h4>
            <p>towards the end of the Precambrian, and possibly somewhat earlier. It had long been doubted
                whether these
                life-forms included animals, but the discovery of the animal lipid cholesterol in fossils of Dickinsonia
                establishes their nature. Animals are thought to have originated under low-oxygen conditions </p>
